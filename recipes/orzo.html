    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This easy Chicken Alfredo Orzo with broccoli is a one pot spin on Chicken & Broccoli Alfredo with Fettuccine. The recipe features jarred Alfredo Sauce, which makes prep a breeze.  By switching to orzo pasta (shaped like rice if you are not familiar), I'm able to cook the meal all right in one skillet, and the results are creamy and somewhat reminiscent of risotto (without all the pot watching). I loathe doing dishes, so just one dirty pan, a cutting board and a couple utensils, has a lot of appeal to me.  The fact that a satisfying and flavorful dinner is on the table in less than a half hour is something any busy parent has to love.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 ½ tablespoons butter </li>
            <li> 1 clove garlic, minced </li>
            <li> 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces </li>
            <li> 2 cups fresh broccoli florets </li>
            <li> 8 ounces orzo pasta </li>
            <li>2 cups low-sodium chicken stock</li>
            <li> 1 (24 ounce) jar Ragu® Classic Alfredo Sauce </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic, and cook for about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in chicken and saute until the surface of the chicken loses most of its pink color. Add the broccoli; stir to coat. Stir in orzo.
